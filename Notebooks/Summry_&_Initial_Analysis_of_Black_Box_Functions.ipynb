        "## Function 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Detect likely contamination sources in a two-dimensional area, such as a radiation field, where only proximity yields a non-zero reading. The system uses Bayesian optimisation to tune detection parameters and reliably identify both strong and weak sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (10, 2)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (10, )\n",
        "\n",
        "You have a 2D area where most points give zero readings and only points near a contamination source give anything meaningful. The optimisation must explore widely because the signal is sparse. It needs strong exploration and methods that can detect multiple separate peaks rather than just one best location.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 2\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a black box, or a mystery ML model, that takes two numbers as input and returns a log-likelihood score. Your goal is to maximise that score, but each output is noisy, and depending on where you start, you might get stuck in a local optimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle this, you use Bayesian optimisation, which selects the next inputs based on what it has learned so far. It balances exploration with exploitation, making it well suited to noisy outputs and complex functions with many local peaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (10, 2)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (10, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This is also 2D, but the function is noisy and has local optima. The optimisation is easier than Function 1 because the landscape is continuous rather than mostly zero, but you still need to balance exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in local peaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 3\n",
        "\n",
        "You’re working on a drug discovery project, testing combinations of three compounds to create a new medicine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each experiment is stored in `initial_inputs.npy` as a 3D array, where each row lists the amounts of the three compounds used. After each experiment, you record the number of adverse reactions, stored in `initial_outputs.npy` as a 1D array.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to minimise side effects; in this competition, it is framed as maximisation by optimising a transformed output (e.g. the negative of side effects).\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (15, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (15, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a small 3D problem where experiments are expensive and the output is a transformed version of something you normally want to minimise. Because experimental noise and non-Gaussian behaviour can occur (e.g., side-effect counts), the optimisation should be careful and conservative, focusing on reducing uncertainty and avoiding bad regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 4\n",
        "\n",
        "Address the challenge of optimally placing products across warehouses for a business with high online sales, where accurate calculations are costly and only feasible biweekly. To speed up decision-making, an ML model approximates these results within hours. The model has four hyperparameters to tune, and its output reflects the difference from the expensive baseline. Because the system is dynamic and full of local optima, it requires careful tuning and robust validation to find reliable, near-optimal solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (30, 4)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (30, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This 4D problem is dynamic and full of local optima. The model outputs may vary over time because the business environment changes. The optimisation should therefore emphasise robustness, repeatability and validation rather than purely chasing the highest single score.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 5\n",
        "\n",
        "You’re tasked with optimising a four-variable black-box function that represents the yield of a chemical process in a factory. The function is typically unimodal, with a single peak where yield is maximised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to find the optimal combination of chemical inputs that delivers the highest possible yield, using systematic exploration and optimisation methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (20, 4)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (20, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This 4D function is unimodal. That means there is only one main peak, so optimisation is much easier. You can rely more on exploitation and move quickly toward the best region without needing complicated global-search strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 6\n",
        "\n",
        "You’re optimising a cake recipe using a black-box function with five ingredient inputs, for example flour, sugar, eggs, butter and milk. Each recipe is evaluated with a combined score based on flavour, consistency, calories, waste and cost, where each factor contributes negative points as judged by an expert taster. This means the total score is negative by design.\n",
        "\n",
        "To frame this as a maximisation problem, your goal is to bring that score as close to zero as possible or, equivalently, to maximise the negative of the total sum.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (20, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (20, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This is 5D, with a noisy human-evaluated score that is always negative. The optimisation aims to move the score closer to zero. Because human judgement introduces noise and inconsistency, the method should handle noise well and maintain moderate exploration to avoid misleading results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 7\n",
        "\n",
        "You’re tasked with optimising an ML model by tuning six hyperparameters, for example learning rate, regularisation strength or number of hidden layers. The function you’re maximising is the model’s performance score (such as accuracy or F1), but since the relationship between inputs and output isn’t known, it’s treated as a black-box function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because this is a commonly used model, you might benefit from researching best practices or literature to guide your initial search space. Your goal is to find the combination of hyperparameters that yields the highest possible performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (30, 6)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (30, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a common 6D machine-learning hyperparameter tuning task. Evaluations are expensive, so the optimiser must use prior knowledge (e.g., good ranges for learning rates) and avoid unnecessary exploration. The goal is to find the best model performance while avoiding overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function 8\n",
        "\n",
        "You’re optimising an eight-dimensional black-box function, where each of the eight input parameters affects the output, but the internal mechanics are unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your objective is to find the parameter combination that maximises the function’s output, such as performance, efficiency or validation accuracy. Because the function is high-dimensional and likely complex, global optimisation is hard, so identifying strong local maxima is often a practical strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, imagine you’re tuning an ML model with eight hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, number of layers, dropout rate, regularisation strength, activation function (numerically encoded), optimiser type (encoded) and initial weight range. Each input set returns a single validation accuracy score between 0 and 1. Your goal is to maximise this score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input: (40, 8)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: (40, )\n",
        "\n",
        "This is 8D and fully black-box. High-dimensional problems are harder for Bayesian optimisation because models become less reliable as dimension increases. Here the goal often becomes finding a good local optimum rather than the perfect global best. The optimiser may need specialised high-dimensional strategies and more exploration.\n"
