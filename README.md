# Capstone Project â€“ Imperial College London AI & Machine Learning Certificate

## Overview  
This repository contains my capstone project for the Imperial College London AI & Machine Learning Certificate.  
The aim is to design, implement, and evaluate an ML solution that demonstrates not only technical proficiency but also practical impact.

## Goals  
- Define and frame a real-world problem in the context of AI/ML.  
- Collect, preprocess, and analyze relevant data.  
- Develop and train ML models to address the problem.  
- Evaluate performance with appropriate metrics.  
- Present insights, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.  

## Key Technologies  
- Python (core programming language)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (data wrangling & classical ML)  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (deep learning frameworks)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (visualizations)  
- Jupyter Notebooks (experiments & analysis)
